# SaaS Export

Flux AI can export an agent as a portable bundle (zip) containing:

- agent.json: workflows and metadata
- README: instructions

Future: Generate a full Next.js + Express app with the workflow embedded and a simple auth layer. For now, use `/export/agent/:agentId` to download the zip.
