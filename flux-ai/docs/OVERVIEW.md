## Flux AI Overview

Flux AI enables creation of AI agents through a node-based workflow editor. Core concepts:

- Agents: Own one or more workflows, credentials, and settings
- Nodes: Brain, Memory, API, Trigger, Storage, Output, Custom
- Edges: Connections that define data flow
- Executions: Real-time runs with logs, metrics, and replay

This document describes architecture, data model, and extensibility at a high level.
